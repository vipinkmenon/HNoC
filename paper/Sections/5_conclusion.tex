\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper we discussed the implementation of an asynchronous binary tree based NoC architecture targeting FPGA implementation and compared with other tree and mesh implementations.
It could be seen that for low performance applications, binary trees are best suitable due to their high throughput to resource utilization ratio.
For high-performance large NoC sizes, mesh topology is the ideal candidate.
For high-performance small NoC sizes, AsyncBTree is a suitable candidate.
In future we will be analyzing the effect of using asynchronous switches with other topologies such as mesh and torus.
Implementation of AsyncBTree and binary tree are provided as open source which could complement the CONNECT NoC platform~\cite{hnoc}.
