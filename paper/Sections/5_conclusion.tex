\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper we discussed the implementation of an asynchronous binary tree based NoC architecture targeting FPGA implementation.
Analysis shows that FPGA archtiecture specific optimization can provide high clock performance and low resource consumption for such implementation compared to traditional fat-tree based implementations.
It also shows the advantage of fixed size interface to PEs compared to variable size interface when targeting the NoC for partial reconfiguration.
Implementation of the proposed architecture is provided as an open source enabling other researchers to verify its functionality and to use in practical NoC-based applications~\cite{hnoc}.
In the future we will be anayzing the effect of GALS-based implementation of other network topologies when targeting FPGA implementations.
