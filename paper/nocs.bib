  Annote                   = {First sentence is very peculiar.... Looks like I had observed similar ASIC/ Fpga trends... Virtual channels are rubbish... Deep pipelining may be tricky - increases latency.... Section 3 does well to frame the Fpga argument... Can it deliver? So the dumb compile does let sota run faster... Did frequency results use floor planning? It would be useful to see how this holds up against the anti- pipelining argument... Higher radix networks support higher load? High level bits... * Ok, so the setup Fpga vs. ASIC was nice. * However, delivery on these claims was a bit unimpressive.... * Scaling trends need better explanations... * VC case not justified..... * tree beat mesh :) what is B/W of the fat tree? 10% larger, 10% slower.... 10% higher load support.... * experimental results use random traffic... Do Virtual Channels even matter for FPGAs???? - extrapolating from Table 2, we can end up 20-30% smaller than smallest VC case... - remembering story from 2006/11 when switching gears to PhD....}
